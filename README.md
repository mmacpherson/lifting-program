## A Lifting Program

This notebook generates a program based on one variant of the Heavy-Medium-Light scheme.

How it works: you pick three lifts; I picked deadlift, squat, and press. Each week you'll do one of them heavy on Monday, one of them medium on Wednesday, and one of them light on Friday. It uses a simple linear progression, running in seven-week cycles of two three-week subcycles plus a rest week.
